                <p>Shotokan Karate is one of the most widely practiced styles of traditional karate. It is characterized by linear techniques, firm stances, and an emphasis on discipline, respect, and continuous improvement. The practice involves kihon (basic techniques), kata (forms), and kumite (fighting), which together develop not only physical conditioning but also concentration and self-control. The style is disseminated worldwide by the Japan Karate Association (JKA), known for preserving traditional principles and foundations.</p>
                <p>In my case, I've been practicing karate for about 10 years, dedicating myself to the Shotokan style associated with the <a href=https://www.jka.or.jp/en/ target="_blank">JKA.</a> Over this period, I've had the opportunity to constantly evolve, and today I'm a black belt, first dan. Practice has become an important part of my routine, contributing to both personal discipline and physical and mental development.</p>
