By averaging the energy, valence, and danceability of the 100 songs, I can identify the two highest values to describe the listener’s audio aura. For example, high energy and valence might suggest an aura of “excited” and “happy.”

This approach treats all songs equally and ignores play count, emotional context, and temporal patterns. A better method would weight songs by play count, analyze trends over time, and include other factors like lyrics or genre for a fuller emotional picture.
